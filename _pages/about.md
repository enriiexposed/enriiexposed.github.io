Hi there! This is my personal blog/portfolio where I'll be uploading various posts about Comp Science in general

There are also sections in which you can see my [CV]({{ site.baseurl }}/cv/), or even get in touch with me.

To start off, go to the [Blog Posts]({{ site.baseurl }}/year-archive/) section to see my latest uploads.

Last but not least, check the [Terms and Conditions]({{ site.baseurl }}/terms/) of the page

Let's Code! :grinning:
